"""
Play Catan with Auto-Generated Prompts
---------------------------------------
This version generates AI prompts for each player at the START of every turn.

During the game, you'll see:
- Game proceeds normally
- At each turn start, prompts are automatically generated for all players
- Prompts are saved to: examples/ai_testing/my_games/prompts/

This lets you see exactly what each AI agent would receive as input.

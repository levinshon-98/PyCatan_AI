This gives me a high-probability yield for road-building and settlement-expansion resources. My main goal now is to secure access to Wheat and Ore, which are currently missing from my portfolio. Looking at the neighbors of Node 20, I have three options for my starting road: Node 10, Node 21, and Node 19. Node 21 leads toward Node 32, which would give me access to Wheat (Wh9), but it is also adjacent to the Desert (Hex 10). Node 19 leads toward more Brick (B10). However, Node 10 is the most attractive direction. It leads toward Node 11 (B6, S5, W12) and Node 9, which features a 3:1 port. Given that I have high production on 6 and 8, having a 3:1 port early will be crucial for trading away excess resources for the Ore and Wheat I'll need for cities and development cards. Therefore, I will place my road from Node 20 to Node 10 to facilitate expansion toward the port and higher-probability nodes.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I've started at 20 (6-8-11).

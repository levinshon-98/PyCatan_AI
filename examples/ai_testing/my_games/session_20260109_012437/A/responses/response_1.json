My strategy is to pick a node that provides a good combination of diverse resources and high-probability dice rolls (6s and 8s) to maximize early resource generation. I've analyzed the nodes and identified Node 20 as a strong candidate. Node 20 connects to Hexes 9 (W11), 5 (B6), and 4 (S8). This gives me Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8). The B6 and S8 are high-probability numbers, and W11 adds to resource diversity. This will provide a solid foundation for building roads and additional settlements early in the game. Node 10 was also a strong contender, but Node 20 has a slightly better Wood roll (11 vs 12).\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 20}\"}}",

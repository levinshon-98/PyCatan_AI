**Thinking:** This is the first turn of the game (SETUP_FIRST_ROUND), and I am player A, so I get the first pick for a settlement and an adjacent road. My strategy is to secure a node with a strong combination of r...

**Note to Self:** First pick: Node 20 (W11, S8, B6). Road to Node 19. This secures Wood, Sheep, Brick for early expansion. For the second settlement (my last pick), prioritize a strong Wheat/Ore spot, ideally Node 41 (O5, Wh9, B10) if available, or Node 24 (O3, Wh8, W3), Node 25 (S4, O3, Wh8), or Node 35 (S11, Wh6, O3).

**Says:** "I'm starting strong with a focus on early expansion! Let's see what the board has in store."

**Thinking:** The game is in the SETUP_FIRST_ROUND phase, and I have just placed my first settlement at Node 20. My `note_from_last_turn` clearly outlined this move: "First pick: Node 20 (W11, S8, B6). Road to Node...

**Note to Self:** Confirmed first settlement at Node 20 (W11, B6, S8) and road to Node 19. For the second settlement (my last pick in this round), I still need to prioritize a strong Wheat/Ore spot. Node 41 (O5, Wh9, B10) remains a high priority if available, followed by Node 24 (O3, Wh8, W3), Node 25 (S4, O3, Wh8), or Node 35 (S11, Wh6, O3). I will need to observe Player B's next move to see what nodes they claim, which will influence my final decision.

**Says:** "My first settlement is placed, and now my first road. I'm focusing on securing resources for a strong early game build out!"

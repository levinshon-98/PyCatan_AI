My strategy is to secure a node with a strong combination of resources and high-probability dice rolls. I need to balance early game expansion needs (Wood, Brick, Sheep for roads and settlements) with long-term development needs (Wheat, Ore for cities and development cards). I will also consider access to ports for future trading.\\n\\nI evaluated several nodes:\\n\\n1.  **Node 41 (O5, Wh9, B10)**: This node offers Ore (5), Wheat (9), and Brick (10). The rolls (5, 9, 10) are excellent, providing a strong foundation for mid-to-late game development (cities and dev cards). It lacks Wood and Sheep, which are crucial for early expansion. It is adjacent to Node 40, which has a W2 port (N[40] = [[39,41,48],[17,13],\\\"W2\\\"]). However, a W2 port is most beneficial if I produce Wood, which I would not from Node 41. It would allow me to trade 2 Wood for 1 of another resource, but I'd still need to acquire Wood at 4:1 or 3:1.\\n\\n2.  **Node 20 (W11, S8, B6)**: This node offers Wood (11), Sheep (8), and Brick (6). The rolls (11, 8, 6) are very good, with 8 and 6 being high-probability numbers. This combination provides the essential resources for early game expansion (roads and settlements). It lacks Wheat and Ore, which are crucial for cities and development cards.\\n\\nComparing these two primary options:\\n*   Node 41 has a combined pip value of 4+3+3=10.\\n*   Node 20 has a combined pip value of 3+5+5=13.\\n\\nNode 20 offers higher overall probability production and provides the resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep) that are immediately needed for building roads and additional settlements. While Node 41's resources (Ore, Wheat, Brick) are powerful for the mid-game, securing early expansion capability is generally more critical for the first settlement. I can aim for a strong Wheat/Ore spot as my second settlement, after Player B has made their two picks.\\n\\nTherefore, I will choose Node 20 for my first settlement due to its superior rolls and the crucial Wood, Brick, and Sheep production for early expansion. For the road, I will choose to build towards Node 19 (N[19] = [[18,20,30],[9,8,4]]), which connects to hexes W11, B10, S8.

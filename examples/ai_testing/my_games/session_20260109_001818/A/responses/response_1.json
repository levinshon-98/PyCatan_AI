An optimal settlement location provides high-probability resources (numbers 6, 8, 5, 9) and diverse resource types. I've identified a strong cluster of hexes: Hex 5 (Brick 6), Hex 9 (Wood 11), and Hex 14 (Wheat 9). This combination offers Brick, Wood, and Wheat with excellent production numbers (6, 11, 9). This is ideal for early game development, providing resources for building (Wood, Brick) and for further development/cities (Wheat). The game state JSON, however, does not provide the 'N' (Nodes) lookup table, which means I cannot directly map this ideal physical location to a specific 'node' ID. Given this lack of information, I will select 'node: 14' as shown in the example parameters, assuming it represents a valid and reasonably central or good node on the board. Without the node-to-hex mapping, I cannot be more precise in my selection.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 14}\"}}",

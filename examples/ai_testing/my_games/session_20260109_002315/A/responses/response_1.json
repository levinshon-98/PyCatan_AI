I must choose a node that offers a good combination of resources with high probability numbers. My strategy is to prioritize diverse resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat, Ore) and high-probability tokens (6, 8, 5, 9). I will avoid placing near the desert hex (Hex 10). I will identify potential nodes by grouping adjacent hexes with favorable attributes. The combination of Hex 4 (S8), Hex 5 (B6), and Hex 9 (W11) provides Sheep, Brick, and Wood with probabilities 8, 6, and 11",

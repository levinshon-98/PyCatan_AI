This is an excellent foundation for a city-heavy or development card strategy later in the game. However, I am currently completely lacking Wood, Brick, and Sheep. My primary goal for this road and my subsequent settlement placement must be to secure these missing resources. Looking at the neighbors of node 42 (41, 43, and 50), node 41 is the most strategic choice. It leads toward hex 13 (Brick 10) and node 31, which is a high-value 9-10-11 spot (Wheat 9, Brick 10, Wood 11). While Alice is already on the Wood 11 hex and her road is heading toward node 31, building toward 41 allows me to contest that area or pivot to node 40, which offers a Wood 2:1 port and Brick 10. Node 50 (the 3:1 port) is a fallback, but securing Brick and Wood production is more urgent than a port right now. My second settlement will likely need to prioritize Sheep, as it's the only basic resource I can't easily reach from this starting position.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Alice has a very balanced start on 11-6-8 (Wood, Brick, Sheep). She'll be a key trading partner for my excess Wheat/Ore. Charlie places next (two settlements), so I need to see if he takes the prime Sheep spots (Node 12 or 25) or the 9-10-11 spot (Node 31). If 31 is taken, I'll focus on getting Sheep and using a port to trade for Wood/Brick.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"That 5-9-9 spot looks like it'll keep me fed!

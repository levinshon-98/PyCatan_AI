My strategy is to choose a node that provides a good mix of essential resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat, Ore) with high-probability numbers (6s and 8s are best, followed by 5s and 9s). I analyzed the hexes and nodes to find the best spot. Node 20 connects to Hex 9 (W11), Hex 5 (B6), and Hex 4 (S8). This provides Wood, Brick, and Sheep. The numbers are 11 (low), 6 (high), and 8 (high). This gives me two high-probability resources (Brick and Sheep) and a source of Wood, which is crucial for early expansion (roads and settlements). Other strong nodes were considered, such as Node 42 (Wh9, O5, Wh9), which offers great Wheat and Ore, but lacks Wood, Brick, and Sheep, making early expansion difficult. Node 20 offers a balanced start for building and expanding.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 20}\"}}",

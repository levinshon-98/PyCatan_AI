My goal is to select a node that provides a good combination of resources and high-probability dice rolls. I've analyzed the board state to identify promising nodes. Node 19 stands out because it provides Wheat (9), Brick (10), and Ore (5). These are excellent resources for development (Wheat for cities, Brick for roads/settlements, Ore for cities) and the numbers (9, 10, 5) are all high-probability rolls. This offers strong early game potential for building and upgrading.\",\"action\":{\"type\":\"place_starting_settlement\",\"parameters\":\"{\\\"node\\\": ",

I need Wood and Brick for roads, and Wheat and Sheep for settlements and development cards. Ore becomes more important in the mid to late game for cities and development cards. I must avoid nodes adjacent to the desert (Hex 10) for my initial placement, as they provide fewer resources. I will prioritize nodes that border three hexes and have high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9). I have carefully reviewed all possible nodes.\\n\\nAfter analyzing the board, Node 20 stands out as the optimal choice. It connects to Hex 9 (Wood 11), Hex 5 (Brick 6), and Hex 4 (Sheep 8). This combination provides Wood, Brick, and Sheep, which are the essential resources for rapid expansion in the early game. The production numbers (6, 8, 11) are excellent, with 6 and 8 being the highest probability rolls after 7, ensuring a consistent income. The total pips for this node are 3 (for 11) + 5 (for 6) + 5 (for 8) = 13, which is one of the highest on the board for a non-desert node. This placement allows me to quickly build roads and a second settlement, securing more resources and strategic positions. Other strong contenders like Node 10, Node 11, and Node 12 also offer Wood, Brick, and Sheep, but their number combinations (e.g., W12, W3) are slightly less favorable than Node 20's W11. Nodes rich in Ore and Wheat are good for later stages but less crucial for the very first settlement where expansion is key.\",\"action\":{\"type\":\"place_starting_settlement\",\"parameters\":\"{\\\"node\\\": 20}\"}}",

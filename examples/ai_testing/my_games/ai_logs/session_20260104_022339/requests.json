Therefore, I will settle at Node 25. For the road, I have two main options from Node 25: to Node 24 (O3, Wh8, W3) or to Node 26 (S4, Wh8, O2 port). Building to Node 24 will give me access to W3, completing a critical set of resources (S, O, Wh, W) for early expansion and development, only missing Brick. Building to Node 26 would give me an O2 port, which is strong for Ore, but I'd be missing both Wood and Brick, making early road/settlement expansion harder. Therefore, I will build my road from 25 to 24 to secure Wood.\", \"say_outloud\": \"I'll take node 25 and build my road to 24.\"}",

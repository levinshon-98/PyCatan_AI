I need resources for building roads and settlements early on (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat) and eventually Ore for cities. I evaluated various nodes based on the resources they provide, their associated dice roll probabilities, and the presence of ports. Nodes 10, 11, and 20 all offer excellent Brick and Sheep production on high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5) along with some Wood. Specifically, Node 10 (B6, S8, W12) provides Brick (6), Sheep (8), and Wood (12). This combination gives me two essential building resources (Brick, Sheep) on strong numbers, plus Wood. This is a solid foundation for early expansion and sets me up to acquire Wheat and Ore with my second settlement. While nodes with Ore (like Node 41 or 42) are attractive, securing a broad base of basic resources for initial development is often more critical as the first player.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 10}\"}}",

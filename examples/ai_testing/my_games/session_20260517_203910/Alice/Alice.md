**Thinking:** Best raw setup spot is node 20: 12 pips and a strong mix of wood/brick/sheep, which keeps early road and settlement options open. Node 43 has slightly higher pips but is all wheat, which is too narrow for setup. Node 20 is the strongest balanced start.

**Note to Self:** Setup board: best verified available node is 20 (Wood 11, Brick 6, Sheep 8). No occupied nodes or adjacent buildings were reported in tool results for it.

**Thinking:** Road to 10 is best: it gives the strongest immediate pips (11) and the best future reach, with a 2-step node 11 at 10 pips and a nearby 3:1 port at node 9. The other options are weaker: 19 has only 10 pips and poorer follow-up, 21 is clearly worse. Choose the road that opens the most flexible expansion.

**Note to Self:** Starting settlement at node 20. Best verified road choice: 20-10. Node 10 path has depth-2 access to node 11 (10 pips) and port at node 9.

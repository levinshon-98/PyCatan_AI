My position on the board is currently balanced, with settlements at Node 20 (W11, B6, S8) and Node 44 (O2, Wh9, Wh6). My next strategic move will be to use the Road Building card on my next turn to expand toward the 3:1 ports. Specifically, building from Node 10 to Node 9 will provide access to a port and the 8-Sheep/12-Wood hexes, while extending from Node 52 to Node 51 will secure another 3:1 port and the 9-Wheat hex.

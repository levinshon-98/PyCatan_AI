AI_2 is the only player with Wood and Brick right now, but they are likely to use them for their own expansion. Since I can't build any structures or upgrade to a city (which requires 3 Ore), buying a development card is the most strategic move. It could grant me a Knight for future board control, a Victory Point, or a progress card like Road Building or Year of Plenty that would accelerate my path to the port.

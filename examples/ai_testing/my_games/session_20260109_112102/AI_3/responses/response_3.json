This node provides a balanced mix of Sheep (4), Ore (3), and Wheat (8), which complements my first settlement at Node 12 (Wood 3, Brick 6, Sheep 5). By taking Node 25, I secure all five resources from the start, which is a strong foundation for any strategy. Node 25 has a total of 10 pips (3+2+5), making it one of the highest production spots remaining. I'll build my road towards Node 26 to position myself for the 2:1 Ore port, which will be valuable since I'll have Ore production. This also places me in a good position to eventually connect my two settlements through Node 14 and 24, giving me a solid path for Longest Road. AI_2 has a very strong spot at Node 42 (13 pips), but my balanced production should allow me to compete effectively. I'm choosing 25 over 44 because the Ore number (3) is slightly more likely than the Ore 2, and it offers better connectivity to my first settlement's expansion path.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I have secured all five resources.

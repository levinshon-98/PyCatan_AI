As AI_3, I have the advantage of placing my first and second settlements back-to-back. My primary goal for the first placement is to secure the highest available production. Node 12 stands out with 11 total pips, providing Wood (3), Brick (6), and Sheep (5). This is a strong starting combination for early road and settlement expansion. It is also safely distant from the existing settlements at 20 and 42. By securing Node 12 now, I can follow up with a second placement that targets Wheat and Ore (likely Node 25 or Node 44) to ensure a balanced economy. Node 12's adjacency to the 6-Brick is particularly valuable as it's the highest-yielding Brick tile on the board, which I will share with AI_1.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I am placing my first settlement on Node 12 (W3, B6, S5).

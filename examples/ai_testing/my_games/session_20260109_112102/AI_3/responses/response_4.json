This balanced production (21 total pips) gives me a strong foundation for any strategy. My primary objective now is to expand towards high-yield locations and connect my settlements to compete for the Longest Road. Node 14 is the most attractive target nearby, offering 10 pips of production (Wheat 8, Wood 4, Wood 3) and sitting strategically between my two positions. By building a road from Node 25 to Node 24, I position myself to reach Node 14 from the south. My existing road from Node 12 to Node 13 already approaches it from the north. Linking these paths at Node 14 will create a continuous chain of 4 roads and secure vital Wood and Wheat income, which are currently my lower-production resources. While the Ore port at Node 26/16 is an option, the immediate production boost and connectivity from Node 14 are more valuable in the early game.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Priority 1: Build towards Node 14 to connect the network and boost Wood/Wheat production.

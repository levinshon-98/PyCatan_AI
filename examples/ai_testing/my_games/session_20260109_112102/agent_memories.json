    "note_to_self": "My economy is now balanced with strong Wheat/Ore and decent Wood/Brick. My Wheat engine is particularly powerful, yielding 3 Wheat every time a 9 is rolled. I need to secure a Sheep source or a port soon. The 3:1 port at Node 50/51 is nearby, and the Wood 2:1 port at Node 40/48 is also an option if I expand through Node 41. Watch AI_1's progress toward the Wood 12; they might compete for the northern routes.",

    "note_to_self": "Priority 1: Build towards Node 14 to connect the network and boost Wood/Wheat production. Priority 2: Monitor AI_2's Ore/Wheat dominance and consider the Ore port (Node 16) if I need to trade for development cards. Priority 3: Keep an eye on AI_1's road building, as they have strong Brick and Wood production.",

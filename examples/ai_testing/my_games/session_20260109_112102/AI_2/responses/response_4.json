This complements my first settlement at node 42, which is heavily focused on Wheat (9, 9) and Ore (5). By placing my road from 31 to 41, I immediately connect my two settlements (since I already have a road from 42 to 41). This gives me a solid starting road length of 2 and creates a flexible corridor for expansion. From node 41, I can move toward node 40 to claim the Wood port or push further into the center. This setup gives me a production source for four of the five resources, with a particularly powerful Wheat engine (yielding 3 Wheat on a roll of 9). My next priority will be securing a Sheep source or utilizing a port to trade my excess Wheat.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"My economy is now balanced with strong Wheat/Ore and decent Wood/Brick. My Wheat engine is particularly powerful, yielding 3 Wheat every time a 9 is rolled. I need to secure a Sheep source or a port soon. The 3:1 port at Node 50/51 is nearby, and the Wood 2:1 port at Node 40/48 is also an option if I expand through Node 41.

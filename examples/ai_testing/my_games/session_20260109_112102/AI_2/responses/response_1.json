Node 42 stands out significantly; it borders two Wheat 9 tiles and an Ore 5 tile, providing a total of 12 pips (4+4+4) specifically for the Wheat/Ore strategy, which is essential for late-game cities and development cards. Node 43 is also tempting with 13 pips of pure Wheat (Wh6, Wh9, Wh9), but the inclusion of Ore on Node 42 makes it a more versatile first placement. Securing this powerhouse spot early is crucial as other players will likely target the high-yield Wheat/Ore cluster in the south.

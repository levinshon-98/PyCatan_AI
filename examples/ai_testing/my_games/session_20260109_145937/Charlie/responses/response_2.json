This is a solid 11-pip start with a good mix of expansion resources. Now, I need to decide where to point my starting road. My options are nodes 11, 13, and 22. Node 11 leads toward the coast and the Wheat port, but the inland production is mediocre. Node 22 borders the Desert (Hex 10), which limits its potential. Node 13, however, is a very strategic direction. It leads toward Node 5, which is a high-yield 13-pip location featuring Wood 4, Sheep 8, and Brick 6. Securing Node 5 would give me a massive boost in production and strengthen my hold on the Wood and Brick resources. Additionally, the path toward Node 13 keeps me away from the Desert and provides flexibility to expand toward the center or further along the coast if needed. Given that I plan to place my second settlement near the Wheat and Ore tiles to round out my resource needs, establishing a strong production base in the Wood/Brick area is priority.

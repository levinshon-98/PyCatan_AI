My best available option for the first settlement is Node 12, which provides 11 pips (Brick 6, Sheep 5, Wood 3). This gives me a strong start for expansion with Wood and Brick. Since this is a 3-player snake draft, I will be placing my second settlement immediately after this round. I plan to target Node 25 (Wheat 8, Ore 3, Sheep 4) for my second settlement to ensure I have access to all five resources and a path toward the Ore port.

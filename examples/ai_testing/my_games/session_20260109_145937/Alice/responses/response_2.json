This provides a very strong foundation for early-game expansion, specifically for building roads and settlements. My next priority is to secure a source of Wheat and Ore to balance the economy for development cards and cities. Looking at the adjacent nodes for my first road, I have three choices: Node 10, Node 19, and Node 21. Node 21 is undesirable as it borders the Desert (Hex 10). Node 10 leads toward the coast and a potential 3:1 port (Node 9), but the production there (W12, S8, B6) is slightly less optimal than other paths. Node 19 (W11, B10, S8) is a strong production spot that maintains my current resource focus while moving me closer to the center of the board and the high-value Wheat 9 at Hex 14 (accessible via Node 30 or 31). By pointing my road toward Node 19, I am setting up for a potential third settlement that could either double down on high-probability Brick/Sheep or bridge the gap toward the Wheat-heavy southern region. This placement offers the best flexibility for future expansion while keeping me within reach of the ?3 port if I decide to pivot that way later. I'm also keeping an eye on the southern Ore spots (Node 42) for my second settlement placement, which I will choose once Bob and Charlie have placed their initial positions.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Claimed Node 20 (6-8-11).

Node 20 stands out as an exceptional starting position, offering a total of 12 pips across three essential resources: Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8). This combination is ideal for early-game expansion, providing the necessary materials for roads and further settlements. While Node 43 offers a higher pip count (13), it is heavily concentrated in Wheat (Wh6, Wh9, Wh9), which could lead to a resource imbalance early on. Node 42 is also strong with 12 pips of Wheat and Ore (Wh9, Wh9, O5), but securing the Wood-Brick-Sheep engine on Node 20 first ensures I have the mobility to claim a Wheat/Ore spot in the second half of the setup phase.

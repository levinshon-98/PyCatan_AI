This provides a strong start for a City and Development Card strategy, especially since Ore is relatively scarce on this board—the only other Ore hexes have numbers 3 and 2. While Node 43 offers a slightly higher yield (13 pips), it is entirely concentrated in Wheat, making it less versatile than the Wheat/Ore mix at Node 42. By taking Node 42 now, I secure the most productive Ore spot before Charlie's double turn.

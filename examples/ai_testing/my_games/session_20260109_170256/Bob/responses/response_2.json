This is a strong start for a city/development card strategy, but I'm completely lacking Wood and Brick. Looking at the expansion possibilities from node 42, node 41 is the most attractive. It borders Brick (10), Ore (5), and Wheat (9), and it leads directly toward node 31 (Brick 10, Wood 11, Wheat 9) and the Wood 2:1 port at node 40. Node 43 is also high production (Wheat 6 and 9), but it doubles down on resources I already have. Node 50 leads to a 3:1 port but has lower overall pip value. Pointing toward 41 gives me the best chance to balance my resources as the game progresses.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Alice is prioritizing the Wood/Brick cluster at the top (nodes 10/20).

My primary objective is to secure a strong and diverse resource income, focusing on Wood, Brick, and Sheep/Wheat for early expansion, and considering Ore for later development. High-probability dice rolls (6, 8, 5, 9) are highly desirable. I have carefully reviewed all nodes, ensuring correct interpretation of the `N` array structure to identify the hexes each node touches, along with their associated resources and dice numbers from the `H` array. This corrected analysis is crucial for optimal decision-making. Node 20 stands out as the strongest initial placement. It touches Hexes 9, 5, and 4, yielding Wood on 11 (2 pips), Brick on 6 (5 pips), and Sheep on 8 (5 pips). This provides a critical combination of Wood, Brick, and Sheep, which are essential for building roads and additional settlements. The total pip count for Node 20 is 12 (2+5+5), which is excellent. More importantly, it features two high-probability rolls (6 and 8) for Brick and Sheep, ensuring consistent income of these vital resources. While Wood on 11 is a lower probability, it completes the essential resource set. Other strong nodes, like Node 12 (W3, B6, S5 - 11 pips) and Node 10 (B6, S8, W12 - 11 pips), also offer WBS, but Node 20's specific combination of dice numbers (two 5-pip rolls) makes it superior. Node 25 (S4, O3, Wh8 - 10 pips) is an attractive option for its Sheep, Ore, and Wheat, especially the Wh8, but starting with WBS is generally more advantageous for early road-building and expansion. Therefore, Node 20 provides the most balanced and high-yield start for securing fundamental building materials, setting up a strong economic foundation for the rest of the game.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Player A is starting with a strong WBS production at Node 20 (W11, B6, S8). This should allow for quick road building and expansion. My next priority should be to secure Wheat and Ore with the second settlement. Node 25 (S4, O3, Wh8) looks like an excellent target for the second settlement to diversify income and gain access to Ore and Wheat, which are currently missing.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"I'm looking for a balanced start to build up my resources quickly.

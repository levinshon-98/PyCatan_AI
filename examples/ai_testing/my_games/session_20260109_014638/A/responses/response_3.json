  "raw_content": "{\n  \"internal_thinking\": \"My current settlement is at Node 35, adjacent to Hexes 16 (Sheep 11), 12 (Ore 3), and 11 (Desert). This provides decent initial production of Sheep and Ore, both vital for development cards and cities, but I am entirely lacking Wood, Brick, and Wheat. The numbers 11 and 3 are good probabilities. As this is the first round of setup, I (Player A) have placed my first settlement, and now I must place my first road. Player B will then place both of their settlements and roads before I place my second settlement and road. My primary goal for this road placement is to maximize my options for a strong and diverse second settlement, anticipating that Player B will claim some of the best spots. I need to consider both a primary target and a robust fallback option for my second placement. The available road placements from Node 35 are to Node 34, Node 37, or Node 25. I will analyze each option in detail.1.  Road from Node 35 to Node 34: This path leads towards Node 45 and Node 33. Node 45 is adjacent to Hexes 19 (Ore 2), 16 (Sheep 11), and 15 (Wheat 6). This is a strong potential second settlement spot as it would provide much-needed Wheat (Wh6) and a second source of Ore (O2), complementing my existing S11 and O3. Duplicating S11 is also beneficial due to its high probability. However, the other node accessible via this path, Node 33, is adjacent to Hexes 15 (Wheat 6), 11 (Desert), and 10 (Desert). This is a very poor settlement location due to two desert hexes and only one resource (Wh6). If Node 45 is taken by Player B, my fallback option along this path is extremely weak.2.  Road from Node 35 to Node 37: Node 37 itself is a 3:1 port, adjacent to Hexes 16 (Sheep 11) and 12 (Ore 3). Placing a road here would give me immediate access to resource conversion, allowing me to trade any three resources for one of my choice. This offers valuable flexibility, especially given my limited initial resource diversity. However, this option does not directly lead to a new resource-producing settlement spot that would provide Wood, Brick, or Wheat. While ports are useful, my priority in the setup phase is to establish a strong and diverse resource income. The nodes further along this path (e.g., Node 27) are also primarily focused on existing resources (S11, O3) and the port, rather than introducing new resource types.3.  Road from Node 35 to Node 25: This path leads towards Node 26 and Node 24.    *   Node 26 is adjacent to Hexes 12 (Ore 3), 7 (Wheat 8), and 16 (Sheep 11), and crucially, it has an Ore 2:1 port. This is an exceptionally strong potential second settlement spot. It provides high-frequency Wheat (Wh8), which is a critical missing resource, and duplicates my S11 and O3 production (both good numbers). The O2 port further enhances my Ore economy and offers excellent trading flexibility. This spot would set me up for a powerful city and development card strategy.    *   Node 24 is adjacent to Hexes 11 (Desert), 7 (Wheat 8), and 6 (Wood 3). This node offers two critical missing resources: Wood (W3) and Wheat (Wh8). If Node 26 is taken by Player B (which is a high possibility given its strength), Node 24 provides an excellent fallback option. Taking Node 24 would round out my resource production to include Sheep, Ore, Wood, and Wheat, providing a balanced foundation for both expansion (roads, settlements) and development.Comparing the options: The road to Node 25 offers the best combination of a premium primary target (Node 26) and a highly valuable fallback option (Node 24). Node 26 is arguably superior to Node 45 (from the 35-34 path) due to the higher Wheat number (8 vs 6) and the O2 port, which provides more flexibility than a direct O2 production. More importantly, Node 24 is a significantly better fallback option than Node 33. Node 24 directly addresses my lack of Wood and Wheat, providing a balanced resource profile, whereas Node 33 is extremely poor. The 35-37 port access is good for flexibility but does not secure new resource production, which is a higher priority at this stage.Therefore, placing the road from 35 to 25 provides the greatest flexibility and strongest potential outcomes for my second settlement, whether I secure the resource-heavy Node 26 or the balanced-resource Node 24. This choice sets me up for a robust early game, adapting to Player B's placements. My short-term tactic is to open up access to these prime locations. My long-term strategy is to build a strong resource engine for cities and development cards, which these nodes facilitate by providing Wheat and strong production numbers. The risk is that Player B takes both 26 and 24, but this path gives me the best chance. I will place the road from 35 to 25.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Aim for Node 26 (Wh8, S11, O3 + O2 port) for second settlement if available.

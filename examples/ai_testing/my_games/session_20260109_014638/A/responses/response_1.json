The pips are 3 (for B10) + 5 (for S8) + 4 (for O5), totaling 12 pips. This is a very high production node with excellent numbers (8 and 5 are very reliable). It's great for development cards (Ore+Sheep) and contributes to cities (Ore). However, it completely lacks Wheat, which is crucial for both cities and dev cards, and Wood, which is essential for early expansion.\\n\\n2.  **Node 11 (B6, S5, W12)**: This node provides Brick, Sheep, and Wood. The pips are 5 (for B6) + 4 (for S5) + 1 (for W12), totaling 10 pips. While B6 and S5 are good, W12 is a very unreliable number, making this spot less consistent than it initially appears. It also lacks Wheat and Ore, which are vital for city upgrades.\\n\\n3.  **Node 14 (Wh8, W3, W4)**: This node offers Wheat, Wood, and Wood. The pips are 5 (for Wh8) + 2 (for W3) + 3 (for W4), totaling 10 pips. While Wh8 is excellent, having two Wood hexes and no Brick, Sheep, or Ore makes this an unbalanced spot for a first settlement. It's good for early road building but not for diverse resource generation.\\n\\n4.  **Node 31 (Wh9, B10, W11)**: This node provides Wheat, Brick, and Wood. The pips are 4 (for Wh9) + 3 (for B10) + 2 (for W11), totaling 9 pips. This is a balanced mix for early game building (roads, settlements) and provides Wheat for cities. However, it lacks both Sheep and Ore, which are essential for cities and development cards, making it slower to reach those goals.\\n\\n5.  **Node 35 (S11, Wh6, O3)**: This node offers Sheep, Wheat, and Ore.

Node 12 offers a high yield of 11 pips, covering Hex 5 (Brick 6), Hex 2 (Sheep 5), and Hex 6 (Wood 3). This combination provides the essential resources for early-game expansion, specifically for building roads and additional settlements. While it lacks Wheat and Ore, I can prioritize those resources with my second settlement placement, perhaps targeting the eastern side of the board near Hex 7 (Wheat 8) or Hex 15 (Wheat 6). Sharing the highly productive Brick 6 with Alice ensures I keep pace with her development. Node 12 also offers a clear expansion path toward the center of the board via Node 13.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Placed first settlement on Node 12 (B6, S5, W3).

This gives me 12 pips of production focused on late-game resources, ideal for building cities and buying development cards. However, I currently lack Wood, Brick, and Sheep. My road placement should facilitate expansion toward these missing resources to balance my economy.\\n\\nAnalyzing the directions from Node 42:\\n1. Toward Node 41: This path leads toward Node 31 (Wh9, B10, W11) and Node 40 (O5, B10, Wood Port). Node 31 offers much-needed Brick and Wood. Node 40 provides a Wood port (W2), which would be incredibly valuable given my high Wheat/Ore production—I can trade surplus Wheat for Wood at a 2:1 rate.\\n2. Toward Node 43: This leads to Node 43 (Wh9, Wh6, Wh9) and Node 44 (O2, Wh9, Wh6). While these are high-pip nodes (13 and 10 pips respectively), they provide redundant resources (more Wheat and Ore).\\n3. Toward Node 50: This leads to the 3:1 ports at Node 50 and 51.\\n\\nChoosing the road to 41 is the most strategic move as it provides a clear path to diversify my resource base and secure a useful port. My second settlement will ideally be placed at Node 12 (W3, B6, S5) to secure Sheep and better Wood/Brick numbers, but this road ensures my first settlement has a strong expansion path.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"My first settlement at 42 is a Wheat/Ore powerhouse.

My second settlement MUST target Node 12 (W3, B6, S5) or Node 5 (W4, S8, B6) to get consistent Wood/Brick/Sheep production. Alice already has Wood/Brick/Sheep, so I need to secure my share before Charlie takes the remaining good spots.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"Decided to point my road toward the coast.

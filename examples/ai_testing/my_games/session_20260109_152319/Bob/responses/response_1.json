It offers a total of 12 pips with high-yield Wheat (two 9s) and Ore (one 5), which are essential for mid-to-late game development and city upgrades. Strategically, placing at Node 42 is a powerful move because it blocks the adjacent Node 43, which has the highest total pip value on the board (13), and Node 41 (11 pips). This effectively secures the most productive region of the map for myself and denies it to Alice, who already expressed a need for Wheat and Ore. While I initially considered Node 41 for its inclusion of Brick, the higher total yield of Node 42 and its superior blocking potential make it the optimal choice. My future strategy will involve securing Wood and Sheep (potentially at Node 12 or 31) to balance my resource income.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I've secured the high-yield Wheat/Ore cluster at Node 42.

Otherwise, I'll look at Node 31 or the Sheep/Wood nodes near the top-left. Alice is already set with Wood/Brick/Sheep, so she'll be looking for Wheat/Ore with her second settlement—I've successfully blocked the best spots for that.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"Hi Alice!

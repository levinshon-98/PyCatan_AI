My strategy is to secure a strong combination of resources, prioritizing a mix that supports both early expansion (Wood, Brick, Sheep) and later development (Wheat, Ore). I lack a direct node-to-hex mapping, so I must infer good locations from the hex data and use the example parameter for the node ID. I've identified a promising location around hexes H13 (Brick 10), H14 (Wheat 9), and H17 (Ore 5), which offers Brick, Wheat, and Ore with strong numbers (10, 9, 5). This combination is excellent for building cities and development cards early. Another strong option is Sheep 8, Brick 6, Wood 11 (from H4, H5, H9) for early expansion. Given the example parameter '{\\\"node\\\": 14}', I will use node 14, hoping it corresponds to the Brick/Wheat/Ore spot (as hex 14 is Wheat 9). This sets me up for a strong development path.\", \"say_outloud\": \"Hello everyone! Time to pick my first spot.

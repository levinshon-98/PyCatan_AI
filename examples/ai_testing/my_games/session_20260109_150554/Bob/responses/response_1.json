Node 12 is an excellent choice, offering 11 total pips across Brick (6), Sheep (5), and Wood (3). This gives me a solid foundation for building roads and settlements. While Node 43 has higher pips (13), it's entirely Wheat, which is less flexible for early-game expansion. By choosing Node 12, I secure the other side of the 6-Brick hex. I'll point my road towards Node 13, which opens a path to Node 14 (Wheat 8, Wood 4) and potentially the 2:1 Brick port at Node 6, which would be extremely powerful given the 6-Brick income. Node 12 is one of the few high-yield Brick spots on the board, making it a high priority for my first placement.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Priority for 2nd settlement: Look for Ore and Wheat to balance the Wood/Brick from Node 12.

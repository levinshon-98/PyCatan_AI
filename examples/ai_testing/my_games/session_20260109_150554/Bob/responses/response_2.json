This is a solid start for resource production, especially the 6-Brick and 5-Sheep. Now I need to place my road. Looking at my expansion options from Node 12, I can go toward Node 11, Node 13, or Node 22. Node 22 is adjacent to the Desert (Hex 10), so that's not ideal. Node 11 is near Alice's settlement at Node 20 (and her road at Node 10), so I might get blocked there. Node 13, however, leads toward Node 14, which sits on Wheat (8), Wood (3), and Wood (4). Getting that Wheat 8 would be a huge boost to my diversity, as I currently lack Wheat and Ore. Additionally, Node 13 is on the path toward the Brick 2:1 port at Node 6/7, which would be incredibly powerful given my access to the 6-Brick. Therefore, I'll place my road from Node 12 to Node 13.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Path set: Node 12 -> 13 -> 14 to secure Wheat (8). Secondary goal: reach the Brick port at Node 6/7.

**Thinking:** The game has just started, and it's my turn to place the first settlement. My strategy is to secure a diverse set of essential resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat) with high-probability numbers (6, 8...

**Note to Self:** My first settlement is on Wood(11), Brick(6), Sheep(8). For the second settlement, I need to prioritize a good source of Wheat and ideally some Ore, or another strong Wood/Brick/Sheep combination if Wheat/Ore is weak elsewhere. Look for nodes with 5, 9, 4, 10, or 3, 11 for these resources.

**Says:** "Hello everyone! I'll kick things off by settling on a spot that gives me a good mix of Wood, Brick, and Sheep."

**Note to Self:** My first settlement is at Node 20 (W11, B6, S8). My primary goal for the second settlement is Node 9 (W12, S8, ?3 port) to secure a strong resource base and early trade flexibility. I need to observe the opponent's moves carefully to see if they attempt to block my path or claim this key node/port.

**Says:** "Alright, setting up my first road! Aiming for a good connection here."

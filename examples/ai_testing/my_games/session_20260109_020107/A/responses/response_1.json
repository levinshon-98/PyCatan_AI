My strategy is to secure a diverse set of essential resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat) with high-probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) to facilitate early game development. I will prioritize nodes that offer at least three distinct resources, ideally including Wood and Brick for roads and settlements, and Sheep for additional settlements or development cards. Wheat is also highly desired for cities and development cards, but sometimes it's better to prioritize the W/B/S combination for the first spot. I will evaluate nodes by assigning points to dice rolls (6, 8 = 5 pts; 5, 9 = 4 pts; 4, 10 = 3 pts; 3, 11 = 2 pts; 2, 12 = 1 pt) and applying a multiplier to essential resources (W, B, S, Wh = 1.5x; O = 1.0x; D = 0x).\\n\\nAfter reviewing the board, several nodes stand out:\\n-   Node 20: Hexes [9,5,4] -> H[9]=W11, H[5]=B6, H[4]=S8. Resources: Wood (11), Brick (6), Sheep (8). Score: (1.5*2) + (1.5*5) + (1.5*5) = 3 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 18.0. This offers excellent diversity (W, B, S) with two high-probability numbers (6, 8).\\n-   Node 10: Hexes [5,4,1] -> H[5]=B6, H[4]=S8, H[1]=W12. Resources: Brick (6), Sheep (8), Wood (12). Score: (1.5*5) + (1.5*5) + (1.5*1) = 7.5 + 7.5 + 1.5 = 16.5. Good diversity, but Wood 12 is a very low probability.\\n-   Node 12: Hexes [6,5,2] -> H[6]=W3, H[5]=B6, H[2]=S5. Resources: Wood (3), Brick (6), Sheep (5). Score: (1.5*2) + (1.5*5) + (1.5*4) = 3 + 7.5 + 6 = 16.5.

Score: (1.5*4) + (1.5*5) + (1.5*4) = 6 + 7.5 + 6 = 19.5.

This node provides access to Wood (H[9]=W11), Brick (H[5]=B6), and Sheep (H[4]=S8), offering a solid foundation for early game development. My current task is to place the first starting road, which must connect to Node 20. The possible adjacent nodes for road placement are 19, 21, and 10. I need to analyze each option to determine the most strategic placement.\\n\\n1.  **Road from 20 to 19**: This path connects to Hexes 9 (W11) and 4 (S8). Node 19 is also adjacent to Hex 8 (B10). This direction leads towards Nodes 18 and 30, which offer more Brick and Wood. While providing additional resources, this path does not immediately open up access to a port or a particularly high-value settlement location.\\n\\n2.  **Road from 20 to 21**: This path connects to Hexes 9 (W11) and 5 (B6). Node 21 is also adjacent to Hex 10 (Desert). This direction leads towards Nodes 22 and 32. The presence of the desert hex (10) makes this route less appealing for immediate resource expansion. Although Node 32 offers Wheat (Wh9), the overall potential from this direction is not as strong as other options.\\n\\n3.  **Road from 20 to 10**: This path connects to Hexes 5 (B6) and 4 (S8). Crucially, Node 10 is also adjacent to Hex 1 (W12), adding a valuable Wood resource with a good roll number. This route leads towards Nodes 9 and 11.\\n    *   **Node 9**: Adjacent to Hexes 4 (S8) and 1 (W12). More importantly, Node 9 is a 'Any 3:1' port (?3). Securing access to a port early is a significant strategic advantage, providing flexibility in trading resources. The combined resources of W12 and S8 are also excellent.\\n    *   **Node 11**: Adjacent to Hexes 5 (B6), 2 (S5), and 1 (W12). This node also offers strong, diverse resources.\\n\\nComparing these options, placing the road from Node 20 to Node 10 is the most advantageous. This move directly positions me to potentially claim Node 9 as my second settlement, which would grant me a strong resource income (W12, S8) and, critically, access to a ?3 port. This port will dramatically improve my ability to trade for needed resources throughout the game, mitigating potential resource imbalances. Even if Node 9 is taken by an opponent, Node 11 remains a strong alternative. This choice prioritizes both resource acquisition and early trade flexibility, setting up a robust long-term strategy.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"My first settlement is at Node 20 (W11, B6, S8).

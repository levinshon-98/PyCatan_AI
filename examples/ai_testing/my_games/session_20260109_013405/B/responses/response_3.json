My first settlement is at node 31, providing Wood (11), Brick (10), and Wheat (9). I need to select a second location that provides Sheep and Ore, and ideally good production numbers, while also avoiding already occupied or blocked nodes. I evaluated several nodes and found Node 25 (Sheep 4, Ore 3, Wheat 8) and Node 35 (Sheep 11, Ore 3, Wheat 6) to be the best options for completing my resource set (Wood, Brick, Wheat, Sheep, Ore). Comparing the two:\\n- Node 25 (S4, O3, Wh8): Total pips 19 (from both settlements). Provides all 5 resources.\\n- Node 35 (S11, O3, Wh6): Total pips 18 (from both settlements). Provides all 5 resources.\\nNode 25 offers a slightly higher overall pip count and a good second source of Wheat (8), which is valuable. While the S4 and O3 are not high probability, they ensure I have access to all necessary resources for future development. This makes Node 25 the optimal choice for a balanced and diverse starting position.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 25}\"}}",

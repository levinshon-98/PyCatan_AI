The game state's 'state.rds' already shows that I have a road from 31 to 41. Assuming this reflects the current board state and I cannot place an existing road, I must choose another adjacent road from Node 31. The neighbors of Node 31 are 30, 32, and 41. Since 31-41 is already present, I consider 31-30 and 31-32. Node 30 connects to Hexes 13 (B10), 9 (W11), 8 (S4), offering Brick, Wood, and Sheep. Node 32 connects to Hexes 14 (Wh9), 9 (W11), 10 (D), offering Wheat, Wood, and Desert. Placing the road 31-30 is strategically better as it opens up access to Sheep and other useful resources, while 31-32 leads to a desert hex, making it less valuable for future expansion. Therefore, I will place the road from 31 to 30.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_road\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"from\\\": 31, \\\"to\\\": 30}\"}}",

My first settlement is at Node 20, yielding Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8). For my second settlement, I prioritize resource diversity, specifically Wheat and Ore, to enable building cities and development cards early. I must place the settlement on an unblocked node (not occupied by another settlement and not adjacent to any existing settlement). I identified all blocked nodes: {10, 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32}. I evaluated several unblocked nodes. Node 35 (connected to Hexes H[15]=\\\"Wh6\\\", H[11]=\\\"O3\\\", H[10]=\\\"D\\\") yields Wheat (6) and Ore (3). This choice provides me with all five resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat, Ore) with good numbers (11, 6, 8, 6, 3), which is crucial for a balanced early game economy and flexibility. I confirmed that Node 35 is not in the blocked list and none of its neighbors ([34, 36, 23]) are in the blocked list, making it a valid placement.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 35}\"}}",

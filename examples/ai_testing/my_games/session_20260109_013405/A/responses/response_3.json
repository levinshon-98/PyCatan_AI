My first settlement at Node 20 provides Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8). For balanced development, I need to prioritize acquiring Wheat and Ore, as these are crucial for building cities and development cards. I first identified all nodes that are unplaceable due to existing settlements (my own at 20, and Player B's at 25 and 31) and the 'at least two nodes away' rule. The unplaceable nodes are 10, 16, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32. I then evaluated available nodes for their resource yields, focusing on Wheat and Ore with good numbers (5, 6, 8, 9, 10). Node 41 stands out as the optimal choice, providing Ore (5) and Wheat (9), along with additional Brick (10). This gives me a well-rounded resource income: Wood (11), Brick (6, 10), Sheep (8), Wheat (9), and Ore (5). This setup is ideal for future expansion and purchasing development cards. The next action will be to place a road connected to this settlement, and I will aim for Node 40 to connect to the Wood 2:1 port.\", \"action\": {\"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\", \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 41}\"}}",

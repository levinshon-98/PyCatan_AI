This path could lead to Node 11 (Brick 6, Sheep 5, Wood 12) or Node 9 (a ?3 port with Sheep 8, Wood 12).Node 10 path is superior because it gives access to Wood 12, which is a strong resource. Furthermore, the ?3 port at Node 9 is connected to two resources (S8, W12), making it a more valuable port to expand towards compared to Node 8 which only connects to S8. This option provides a better mix of resources and a more promising expansion route for future settlements and port access.\",\"action\":{\"type\":\"place_starting_road\",\"parameters\":\"{\\\"from\\\": 20, \\\"to\\\": 10}\"}}",

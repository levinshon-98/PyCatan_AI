While Node 43 offers more pips (13), it would only provide more Wheat, which is redundant. Node 50 offers a 3:1 port but has lower overall production (8 pips). Node 41 provides 11 pips and introduces Brick 10 into my potential income, which is vital for early expansion. Furthermore, this direction leads toward Node 31 (Wood 11, Brick 10, Wheat 9) and a Wood 2:1 port at Node 40, giving me a clear expansion path to balance my resources.

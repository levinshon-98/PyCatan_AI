Analyzing the board using the provided lookup tables, two nodes stand out with 12 pips: Node 20 (W11, B6, S8) and Node 42 (O5, Wh9, Wh9). While Node 20 offers excellent expansion resources (Wood and Brick), Node 42 is a powerhouse for the mid-to-late game, providing the necessary Ore and Wheat for cities and development cards. Ore is relatively scarce on this board, with Hex 17 (O5) being the only high-probability Ore source. By taking Node 42, I secure a dominant position on the best Ore and Wheat tiles. Since I also get the 6th pick in this setup phase, I am confident I can find a decent Wood/Brick spot later, as there are several 10+ pip nodes available (such as 10, 11, 12, 19, 25, 41). Node 42's proximity to a 3:1 port (Node 50/51) is also a strategic advantage.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Claimed Node 42 (O5, Wh9, Wh9) - 12 pips.

Targeting the 3:1 port at Node 50/51 later could be very beneficial given the high Wheat production.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"Starting off with some solid Ore and Wheat at Node 42.

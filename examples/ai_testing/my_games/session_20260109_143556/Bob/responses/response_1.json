It sits at the intersection of Hex 9 (Wood 11), Hex 5 (Brick 6), and Hex 4 (Sheep 8). The 6-Brick and 8-Sheep are particularly valuable as they are high-probability tiles.

Node 20 provides a balanced start for building roads and settlements, which will be crucial for securing a good second position with Wheat and Ore later in the setup phase.

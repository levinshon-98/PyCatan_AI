Node 20 provides a solid foundation with Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8), totaling 12 pips of production (2+5+5). My objective for this road placement is to secure a path toward high-yield expansion sites and a port to mitigate future resource imbalances. Looking at the neighbors of Node 20, the options are nodes 10, 19, and 21. Node 21 is unattractive due to its proximity to the Desert (Hex 10). Node 19 is a viable path toward Node 18 and Node 8, but Node 10 is superior in terms of strategic positioning. Node 10 offers a combined 11 pips from Hex 5 (B6), Hex 4 (S8), and Hex 1 (W12). More importantly, it serves as the gateway to Node 9, which houses a 3:1 port. This port will be crucial for my strategy, as it allows for the conversion of excess Sheep or Brick into necessary Wheat and Ore later in the game. Additionally, Node 10 provides a path to Node 11, which offers another 10 pips of production (B6, S5, W12). By placing the road toward Node 10, I am prioritizing both immediate production potential and long-term trading flexibility, ensuring that I remain competitive as we move into the second round of placements and the early game expansion phase.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I am moving toward the 3:1 port at Node 9 via Node 10.

Alice is already heavy on Wheat and Ore, so I need to secure my own sources before she or Charlie can block them.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"I'm placing my road from Node 20 to Node 10.

The goal is to maximize future resource income and access to a balanced set of resources, considering player A's current placement. Player A has settled at Node 41 (Ore 5, Brick 10) and built a road towards Node 31 (Wheat 9, Brick 10, Wood 11). This means A has access to Ore, Brick, Wheat, and Wood with strong numbers (5, 9, 10, 11). Player A is notably missing Sheep from their initial placement. My strategy is to select a node that provides a strong mix of resources, high-probability numbers, and ideally includes Sheep to differentiate from A. I evaluated several nodes with 3 hexes:\\n\\n1.  **Node 10**: Connects to Hexes 5 (B6), 4 (S8), 1 (W12). Resources: Brick, Sheep, Wood. Numbers: 6, 8, 12. Pips: 11.\\n2.  **Node 20**: Connects to Hexes 9 (W11), 5 (B6), 4 (S8). Resources: Wood, Brick, Sheep. Numbers: 11, 6, 8. Pips: 12.\\n3.  **Node 36**: Connects to Hexes 16 (S11), 15 (Wh6), 11 (O3). Resources: Sheep, Wheat, Ore. Numbers: 11, 6, 3. Pips: 9.\\n\\nNode 20 offers the highest pip count (12) among the strong 3-hex options. It provides Wood, Brick, and Sheep on excellent numbers (6, 8, 11), which are crucial for early game building (roads and settlements) and development cards (Sheep is needed). Importantly, it provides Sheep, a resource Player A currently lacks, giving me a potential trading advantage or a path towards a development card strategy. This placement provides a strong, balanced start, and for the second settlement, I can target Wheat and Ore, potentially using a port like Node 26 (S4, Wh8 + O2 port) to round out my resource production.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Player A is strong on Ore, Brick, Wheat, Wood. I should focus on building out my Sheep production and then seek out Wheat/Ore for my second settlement. Node 26 with its Ore port could be a good target for the second settlement, as it complements the resources from Node 20.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"Alright, time to find a good spot to start my own expansion.

Furthermore, I do not possess 4 of any single resource to initiate a 4:1 bank trade, nor do I have any active 2:1 ports to leverage a more favorable trade. The `meta.dice` field is null, which indicates that the dice roll for my current turn has not yet occurred. Since 'roll_dice' is not an allowed action for me to select, the game system is expected to handle this automatically. However, until that automatic roll occurs and resources are distributed, my current resource pool is fixed. Given these constraints, I am unable to take any productive action on the board. Therefore, the most logical and appropriate action is to end my turn, passing the initiative to the next player. My strategic plan remains to expand towards the W2 port at Node 40 (from my settlement at Node 41, via road 41-40) and the B2 port at Node 7 (from Node 13, via roads 14-15 and 15-7).

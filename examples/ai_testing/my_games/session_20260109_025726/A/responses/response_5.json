The robber is currently on Hex 10, which is a desert, so none of my production hexes are blocked. I do not have enough resources to build a road (needs 1 Wood, 1 Brick), a settlement (needs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat), a city (needs 2 Wheat, 3 Ore), or a development card (needs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore). Since I cannot build anything or play a development card, the optimal and only logical action to advance my game is to roll the dice to acquire resources. This will allow me to accumulate the necessary materials for future building, trading, or purchasing development cards.

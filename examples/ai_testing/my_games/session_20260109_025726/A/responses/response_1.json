My top candidates were Node 10 (W12, B6, S8 - 11 pips), Node 20 (W11, B6, S8 - 12 pips), and Node 41 (O5, Wh9, B10 - 11 pips).\\n\\nNode 20 offered the highest pips for Wood, Brick, and Sheep, which are excellent for early road and settlement expansion.

This combination positions me for strong long-term growth. Crucially, I identified Node 31 (Wh9, B10, W11) as a prime target for my second settlement. If I secure Node 41 and then Node 31, I would gain access to Ore (5), Wheat (9), Brick (10), and Wood (11). This combination would provide a balanced economy covering four essential resources (Ore, Wheat, Brick, Wood) with decent probabilities, allowing for both rapid expansion and strong development card/city production. This strategy prioritizes securing critical development resources early while still having brick for expansion, leading to a more robust long-term game plan. The robber is on a desert hex, so no resource is immediately blocked.\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"place_starting_settlement\",\n    \"parameters\": \"{\\\"node\\\": 41}\"\n  }\n}",

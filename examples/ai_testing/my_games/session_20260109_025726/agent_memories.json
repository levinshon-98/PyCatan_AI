    "note_to_self": "My settlements are at Node 13 (W3, W4, S5) and Node 41 (O5, Wh9, B10). My current resources are W:2, S:1. I need to acquire Brick, Wheat, and Ore to start building roads, settlements, or purchasing development cards. I have roads connecting 41-31 and 13-14. My next strategic moves should focus on building roads towards the B2 port at Node 7 (accessible from Node 13 via 14-15) or the W2 port at Node 48 (accessible from Node 41 via 40). I also need to identify good potential settlement spots that complement my current resource production. Player B has settlements at Node 20 (S, W, O) and Node 26 (W, S, O) and has an O2 port at Node 16. They seem to be focusing on Ore. I should monitor their expansion and resource accumulation, especially for Ore.",

    "note_to_self": "Successfully placed road 26-25. This opens up future expansion towards Node 24 (Ore 9, Wood 3) and Node 36 (Sheep 11). These are excellent resources and will be key for my next settlements or city upgrades. Player A has a strong initial resource base with O5, Wh9, B10, W11. I need to continue expanding towards these high-value hexes to keep pace.",

Looking at the board, node 12 is a very strong balanced option with 11 pips (W3, B6, S5). It provides the core expansion resources (Wood and Brick) with a high-probability 6-Brick. While node 43 has more pips (13), it's entirely Wheat, which is less flexible for a first settlement. Node 42 is also tempting for Ore/Wheat, but I'll prioritize a balanced start and look to secure an Ore spot on my second placement. I'll place my settlement on node 12 and plan to build my road towards node 13 to access more Wood (W4) and stay away from Alice's expansion path.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Alice is on the 6-8-11 and moving north towards the desert/wood.

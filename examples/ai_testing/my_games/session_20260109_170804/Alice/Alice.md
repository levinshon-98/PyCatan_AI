### Response Received ✅

**Latency:** 5.70s | **Tokens:** 8315 (in:5878 out:305) | **Cost:** $0.003854

**Thinking:** This is the first placement of the game. I'm looking for high-yield nodes with a good mix of resources for early expansion (Wood and Brick). Node 20 stands out with a total of 12 pips, including a 6-Brick and an 8-Sheep, which are high-frequency numbers. It also provides 11-Wood. This gives me a strong foundation for building roads and settlements early on. Node 43 has 13 pips but is triple Wheat, which is too specialized for a first placement. Node 42 is good for an Ore/Wheat strategy but lacks the expansion materials I want right now. [Response was too brief]

**Note to Self:** Secured a strong 6/8/11 spot (Node 20). Need to look for Ore and Wheat in the second round to balance the economy.

**Says:** "hey everyone! good luck to us all. i'll start things off over here on the 6-8-11."

**Action:** **place_starting_settlement** - {"node": 20}

### Response Received ✅

**Latency:** 10.40s | **Tokens:** 8889 (in:5586 out:304) | **Cost:** $0.003705

**Thinking:** I've placed my first settlement on Node 20, which gives me great coverage on Wood (11), Brick (6), and Sheep (8). Now I need to decide which direction to point my starting road. Comparing the options: Node 10 has the highest pip value (12) and leads toward a 3:1 port (Node 9) and another solid production spot (Node 11). Node 19 is decent (10 pips) but leads toward slightly lower numbers. Node 21 includes the Desert. Heading toward 10 is the clear winner for expansion potential and securing a port early. [Response was too brief]

**Note to Self:** Headed north toward the 3:1 port and node 11. Still need to prioritize Wheat and Ore for my second placement to round out the economy.

**Says:** "pointing my road north, seems like a good direction to head."

**Action:** **place_starting_road** - {"from": 20, "to": 10}

**Latency:** 22.92s | **Tokens:** 9898 (in:5197 out:339) | **Cost:** $0.003616

**Thinking:** After analyzing the board, Node 20 stands out as the strongest starting position for an expansion-heavy strategy. It provides high-probability access to Brick (6) and Sheep (8), along with Wood (11). In the early game, securing a 6-Brick is crucial because Brick is relatively scarce on this board (the other Brick hexes are 10s). Node 20 has a total of 12 pips, which is excellent. While Node 43 has 13 pips, it is entirely Wheat, which lacks the diversity needed for early growth. By taking Node 20, I secure the best Brick on the board and a very strong Sheep hex, setting myself up to build roads and settlements quickly. [Response was too brief]

**Note to Self:** I am prioritizing early game expansion by taking the best Brick/Sheep combo. I need to look for Ore and Wheat in my second placement to balance my economy for the late game.

**Says:** "hey everyone! let's get this started. i'll take the 6-8-11 spot, looks like a solid base for some early roads."

**Action:** **place_starting_settlement** - {"node": 20}

### Response Received ✅

**Latency:** 19.08s | **Tokens:** 11744 (in:6646 out:321) | **Cost:** $0.004286

**Thinking:** I've placed my first settlement on a strong 6-8-11 intersection (Brick-Sheep-Wood). Now I need to place my road. I have three options: 10, 19, and 21. Node 10 leads towards a 6-8-12 spot and a 3:1 port, which is excellent for production. Node 19 leads towards a 10-11-8 spot, which is also good but slightly lower in total pips. Node 21 leads towards the desert. I'll build towards Node 10 to maximize my future production potential and get closer to that 3:1 port. [Response was too brief]

**Note to Self:** Prioritizing the 6-8-12 expansion or the 3:1 port near node 9. Need to find Wheat and Ore for the second settlement to balance the economy.

**Says:** "pointing this road towards the coast, might grab that port later if the numbers treat me well."

**Action:** **place_starting_road** - {"from": 20, "to": 10}

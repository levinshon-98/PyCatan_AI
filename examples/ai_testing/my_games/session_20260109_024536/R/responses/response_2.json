The key resource missing for a second settlement is Sheep. Analyzing the available road placements from Node 31:\\n1. Road to Node 30: Node 30 is adjacent to Hexes 13 (Brick 10) and 8 (Wheat 8). Building here does not provide any new resources that my current settlement at Node 31 doesn't already produce. It would lead towards Node 39, which is also primarily Brick-focused.\\n2. Road to Node 32: Node 32 is adjacent to Hexes 14 (Wheat 9), 13 (Brick 10), and 9 (Wood 11). These are the exact same hexes as Node 31. This road would not provide access to any new resources and would lead towards Node 33, which borders a desert hex (Hex 10).\\n3. Road to Node 19: Node 19 is adjacent to Hexes 9 (Wood 11), 8 (Wheat 8), and 4 (Sheep 8). Placing a road to Node 19 immediately connects me to a source of Sheep (Hex 4, S8). This is crucial as Sheep is the only resource I lack from my starting settlement for building a second settlement. Furthermore, Node 19 itself is a strong node (W11, Wh8, S8) and opens up expansion towards other potentially good nodes like 20 (W11, B6, S8) which also has brick.\\n\\nTherefore, placing a road from 31 to 19 is the most strategic choice as it grants access to the missing Sheep resource, enabling faster expansion and the placement of a second settlement.

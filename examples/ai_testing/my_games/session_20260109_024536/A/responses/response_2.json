I have three possible road placements: 20-19, 20-21, or 20-10. I need to choose the path that best facilitates future expansion and resource diversification, particularly aiming for Wheat and Ore, which I currently lack.I will analyze each potential road placement:1.  Road 20-19: This path leads towards nodes 18 and 30. Node 19 itself connects to Hexes 9 (W11), 8 (B10), and 4 (S8). Node 18 connects to Hexes 8 (B10) and 4 (S8), offering no new resource types. Node 30 connects to Hexes 13 (B10), 9 (W11), and 8 (B10), again offering no new resource types beyond more Wood and Brick. This path does not enhance my resource diversity.2.  Road 20-10: This path leads towards nodes 9 and 11. Node 10 connects to Hexes 5 (B6), 4 (S8), and 1 (W12). Node 9 connects to Hexes 4 (S8) and 1 (W12) and has a ?3 port. While a port is useful, it's not a specific resource port and doesn't introduce new resource types. Node 11 connects to Hexes 5 (B6), 2 (S5), and 1 (W12), offering more Brick, Sheep, and Wood but no new types. This path also doesn't improve resource diversity significantly.3.  Road 20-21: Node 21 connects to Hexes 10 (Desert), 9 (W11), and 5 (B6). While Node 21 directly exposes me to a Desert hex, it's the gateway to Node 32. Node 32 connects to Hexes 14 (Wh9), 10 (Desert), and 9 (W11). This is a critical discovery: Hex 14 is Wheat 9. By placing a road from 20 to 21, I position myself to build a future settlement at Node 32, which would grant me access to Wheat, a resource I desperately need for development cards and further settlement expansion. This would complete a crucial set of resources (Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat).Given the options, the path towards Wheat via Node 21 and then Node 32 is the most strategically advantageous. It directly addresses my need for resource diversification and sets me up for a stronger mid-game.\",\"note_to_self\":\"My starting settlement is on W11, B6, S8.

My goal is to secure a high-yield position with a good balance of resources, particularly Brick and Wood, which are essential for early expansion. Looking at the board, Node 20 is an exceptional starting location. It sits at the intersection of Hex 9 (Wood 11), Hex 5 (Brick 6), and Hex 4 (Sheep 8). This provides a total of 12 pips, including the highly desirable 6-Brick and 8-Sheep. Brick is relatively scarce on this board, and securing the 6-Brick early gives me a significant advantage in building roads and settlements. While there are high-yield Wheat/Ore spots like Node 42 (12 pips) and Node 43 (13 pips), Node 20 offers the best foundation for early-game expansion. Since I will have the last pick in the second round, I can aim to pick up Ore or a port then. I'll place my first settlement on Node 20.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Placed first settlement on Node 20 (W11, B6, S8).

I'll also look for a port if the high-yield nodes are taken.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"I'm going to start with a strong expansion base at Node 20.

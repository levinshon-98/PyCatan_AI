For my second settlement, my primary goal is to secure a reliable source of Wheat and Ore, as these are essential for building cities and buying development cards later in the game. Looking at the remaining open nodes, Node 43 was my top choice for Wheat, but it is blocked by Bob's settlement at Node 42. Node 44 is the best available alternative, offering two high-probability Wheat tiles (Wh9 and Wh6) and an Ore source (O2). This gives me a total of 10 pips on this node and ensures I have production for all five resources from the start. While Node 18 offers more total pips (12), it lacks Wheat entirely, which would make my early game much more difficult. By choosing Node 44, I'll receive a starting hand of two Wheat and one Ore, providing a balanced foundation for expansion. My plan is to then build a road toward Node 45 to keep my expansion options open along the southern coast.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Second settlement placed at Node 44 (Wh9, Wh6, O2).

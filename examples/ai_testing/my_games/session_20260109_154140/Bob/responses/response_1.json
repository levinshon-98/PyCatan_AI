Node 43 has the highest total pips (13), but it is exclusively Wheat (Wheat 9, Wheat 6, Wheat 9). Node 42 is slightly lower at 12 pips but provides a crucial mix of Ore and Wheat (Ore 5, Wheat 9, Wheat 9), which is essential for building cities and buying development cards. Node 12 (11 pips) and Node 41 (11 pips) are also strong, but securing the best Ore production on the board (Hex 17) at Node 42 is a superior long-term strategy.

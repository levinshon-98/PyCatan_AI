This complements my first settlement at Node 42, which provides Ore (5, 2) and Wheat (9). My goal now is to connect these two settlements to create a strong, unified foundation. My first road was placed between Node 42 and Node 41. By placing this second road between Node 31 and Node 41, I will fully connect my two settlements at the very start of the game. This not only puts me in a great position for the Longest Road later but also secures the path to the Wood 2:1 port at Node 40, which I can reach with just one more road. This connection is the most strategically sound move to ensure mobility and resource flow between my production hubs.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"Settlements 31 and 42 are now connected via Node 41. I have strong Wheat, Ore, Wood, and Brick production. My immediate weakness is Sheep. I should look to expand toward Node 19 or Node 30/29 area if Sheep becomes available, or prioritize getting to a port to trade my surplus Wheat and Wood.\",\n  \"say_outloud\": \"Connecting my settlements early seems like the best way to keep my options open. I'm really liking this setup—it gives me a bit of everything I need to start building, and having a direct link between my two sites should make expansion much smoother.

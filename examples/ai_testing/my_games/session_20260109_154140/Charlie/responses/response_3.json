My primary objective for this second placement is to secure the remaining two resources, Wheat and Ore, to ensure I'm not dependent on trading early in the game. Looking at the board, Node 25 is an excellent choice. It provides Wheat on an 8 (5 pips), Ore on a 3 (2 pips), and additional Sheep on a 4 (3 pips). This totals 10 pips and completes my resource spread perfectly. Node 24 is also an option, but Node 25's proximity to the Ore port (Node 26) and the high probability of the 8-Wheat makes it slightly more attractive for a long-term strategy involving cities and development cards. Alice and Bob have taken some strong interior spots, so securing this coastal position with high-value numbers is a solid move.

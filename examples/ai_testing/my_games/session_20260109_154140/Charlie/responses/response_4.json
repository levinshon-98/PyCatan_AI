To maximize my strategic position, I need to decide which direction to build my second starting road. \\n\\nLooking at the board, building from Node 25 toward Node 24 is the most logical choice. Node 24 (Ore 3, Wheat 8, Wood 3) is a strong expansion point itself, but more importantly, it leads directly to Node 14 (Wheat 8, Wood 3, Wood 4). Node 14 is a high-yield spot (10 pips) and sits exactly between my two settlements. By building toward 24, I set myself up to connect my two positions with just two more roads (13-14 and 14-24). Connecting my settlements early is a powerful move for securing the Longest Road and creating a flexible, unified infrastructure. \\n\\nWhile Node 26 offers an Ore port, my Ore production (on a 3) is currently too low to make a 2:1 port a priority over resource diversity and connectivity. Expanding inland toward the 8-Wheat and 4-Wood hexes will provide the resources I need for mid-game growth. Alice and Bob are positioned far enough away (at Nodes 20 and 42 respectively) that they are unlikely to interfere with this central expansion in the immediate future.\",\n  \"note_to_self\": \"I am pursuing a connectivity strategy.

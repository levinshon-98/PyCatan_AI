# PyCatan AI Project Instructions

## 📋 Project Overview

**PyCatan_AI** is a Python implementation of the Settlers of Catan board game with a focus on AI agent development. The project consists of:

- **Core Game Engine**: Complete implementation of Catan game rules, board management, and resource mechanics
- **Game Management**: Turn-based coordination, action validation, and game state management
- **Player Types**: Support for both human players (CLI) and AI agents
- **Visualization**: Console and web-based game state visualization
- **AI Development**: Framework for building and testing LLM-based AI agents to play Catan

The primary goal is to create intelligent AI agents that can play Settlers of Catan autonomously, making strategic decisions about resource management, building placement, trading, and overall game strategy.
